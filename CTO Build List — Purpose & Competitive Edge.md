⸻

3. App Template System

Purpose:
Schema-driven Next.js base enabling new AI apps to be created from modular templates (app.json, copy.json, theme.json).
Competitive Edge:
AI-based app deployment means instant GTM testing — new ideas can be live in hours instead of weeks, enabling continuous validation cycles and higher hit rates per dev hour.

⸻

4. App Codegen Bot

Purpose:
AI agent that fills app schemas, generates copy, and localizes content automatically.
Competitive Edge:
Automates 80–90% of front-end build work — reducing engineering overhead and letting non-technical operators create functional, on-brand apps fast.

⸻

5. Funnel Builder (No-Code)

Purpose:
Internal tool to create quiz flows, landers, and paywalls without developer input.
Competitive Edge:
Gives Growth Ops and VAs control of A/B/C testing and copy iteration — enables daily funnel testing at near-zero engineering cost.

⸻

6. GTM + Events

Purpose:
Unified analytics layer for all funnels and apps with server-side reliability.
Competitive Edge:
Guaranteed attribution accuracy across channels; better data means faster ROI feedback loops for campaigns and product changes.

⸻

7. Localization Pipeline

Purpose:
AI-assisted translation and QA pipeline for all user-facing copy.
Competitive Edge:
Instant multi-language launches — Estrelar can test or scale a product globally with minimal translation cost or delay.

⸻

8. Content QA

Purpose:
Automated quality and compliance checks before deployment.
Competitive Edge:
Ensures rapid iteration without regression — lets teams ship faster while keeping every site accessible, compliant, and brand-safe.

⸻

9. Paywall Config Service

Purpose:
Server-side API that defines price, copy, and variant per user or geo.
Competitive Edge:
Allows live monetization experiments — test different offers, price points, or trials without rebuilding or redeploying the app.

⸻

10. Price Book

Purpose:
Centralized logic for pricing by currency, region, and tax settings.
Competitive Edge:
Keeps all front-end prices aligned with processor data — no revenue leakage, and simplifies multi-currency launches.

⸻

11. Experimentation (GrowthBook)

Purpose:
Feature-flag and A/B testing framework integrated across apps and paywalls.
Competitive Edge:
Data-driven optimization loop — new features and price points can be validated statistically in real time.

⸻

12. Tracker Ingestion

Purpose:
Consolidate ad and conversion data from Estrelar’s internal tracker.
Competitive Edge:
Ownership of data even when agencies run campaigns — prevents data opacity and enables true ROAS optimization.

⸻

13. Data Spine / Warehouse

Purpose:
Central data hub unifying behavior, payments, and lifecycle events for analysis and ML.
Competitive Edge:
Forms the “brain” — predictive analytics, LTV modeling, churn scoring, and smarter personalization across all products.

14. Payment Ingestion

Purpose:
Capture Solidgate webhooks with 3DS and chargeback detail.
Competitive Edge:
Complete financial visibility — lets Estrelar model fraud, refunds, and payment success to optimize checkout flow and pricing.

⸻

15. BI Dashboards

Purpose:
Provide live metrics for growth, finance, and product performance.
Competitive Edge:
Every decision data-backed — teams can act daily on CAC, ROAS, churn, and LTV data without waiting for analysts.

⸻

16. Reverse ETL

Purpose:
Push warehouse segments (e.g., churn-risk or high-value users) back into marketing tools.
Competitive Edge:
Turns data insights into automated retention and upsell actions — closing the loop between analytics and marketing.

⸻

17. Monorepo & CI/CD

Purpose:
Unified codebase with automated testing, preview deploys, and version control.
Competitive Edge:
Eliminates deployment friction — every change is visible, testable, and reversible in minutes.

⸻

18. RBAC & Audit

Purpose:
Role-based access and change tracking across all internal tools.
Competitive Edge:
Prevents costly mistakes from VA or operator edits; maintains compliance and version history for every change.

⸻

19. WAF & Rate Limits

Purpose:
Protect public endpoints from spam, bots, and abuse.
Competitive Edge:
Improves stability and cost control; prevents performance degradation during campaigns or scraping.

⸻

20. Observability

Purpose:
Real-time monitoring of performance, costs, and failures.
Competitive Edge:
Instant fault detection — minimizes downtime and protects campaign performance during live tests.

⸻

21. Evaluation Harness

Purpose:
Measure AI performance (accuracy, latency, cost) continuously.
Competitive Edge:
Guarantees model quality stays consistent as providers or prompts change; ensures reliability at scale.

⸻

22. Prompt Registry

Purpose:
Central repository for all prompts with version control and rollbacks.
Competitive Edge:
Makes AI behavior reproducible and auditable — safer iteration and fine-tuning across products.

⸻

Summary Advantage

Together, these systems create instant product deployment and feedback loops:
 • AI-generated apps + funnels → faster GTM testing.
 • Centralized paywalls + experiments → dynamic monetization optimization.
 • Unified data spine + BI → smarter growth decisions.
 • Full safety, QA, and governance → compliance without slowing velocity.

Result: Estrelar can ideate, build, test, and scale new digital products 10× faster than a traditional company while maintaining reliability, safety, and real-time learning across every launch.
