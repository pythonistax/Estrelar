Hi! I need you to implement IP-based currency detection for my Coursiv quiz application.

CURRENT SITUATION:
- My quiz currently shows all prices in Euro (€) hardcoded
- I need it to automatically detect the user's location from their IP address
- If IP is from US → show prices in $ (USD)
- If IP is from EU → show prices in € (EUR)
- Default to EUR if detection fails

I have a detailed implementation guide already created in the file: IP_CURRENCY_DETECTION_IMPLEMENTATION.md

Please read that file and implement the IP-based currency detection system according to the guide. The guide includes:
- API endpoint for IP detection
- Currency context/hook for React
- Step-by-step instructions to update all pricing components
- All necessary code snippets

The main files that need updating are:
- components/SellingPage.tsx (has hardcoded € prices)
- components/PaymentSection.tsx (has hardcoded €39.99)
- components/CheckoutModal.tsx (has hardcoded € prices)
- app/api/save-email/route.ts (should capture IP)

Please follow the implementation guide and make sure all prices dynamically change based on the user's IP location. Thank you!
